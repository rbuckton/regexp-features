# description
A <dfn>Subroutine</dfn> is a pre-defined [capture group] or [named capture group] that can be reused in multiple places within the pattern to re-evaluate the subexpression from the group.

# syntax
- `(?(DEFINE)…)` &mdash; Defines a set of reusable [capture groups] that can be referenced elsewhere in the pattern.
- <code>(?<em>n</em>)</code> &mdash; Where *n* is an integer >= 1. Evaluates the [capture group] whose offset is *n*.
- <code>(?-<em>n</em>)</code> &mdash; Where *n* is an integer >= 1. Evaluates the [capture group] whose offset is the *n*th [capture group] declared to the left of the current *Atom*. Example: `(?-1)` would revaluate the last declared [capture group].
- <code>(?+<em>n</em>)</code> &mdash; Where *n* is an integer >= 1. Evaluates the [capture group] whose offset is the *n*th [capture group] declared to the right of the current *Atom*. Example: `(?+1)` would evaluate the next declared [capture group].
- <code>(?&<em>name</em>)</code> &mdash; Evaluates the [named capture group] with the provided *name*.

# example
```re
(?(DEFINE)
  (?<Year>\d{4}|[+-]\d{5,})
  (?<Month>0[1-9]|1[0-2])
  (?<Day>0[1-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])
)
(?<Date>(?&Year)-(?&Month)-(?&Day)|(?&Year)(?&Month)(?&Day))
